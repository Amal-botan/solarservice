      ## Context and Scope
      
      Software design is an important element of software engineering in which, after we established the requirements of the product or system we are building, we make plans and decisions how to best implement those requirements in software.

      This document describes how a design document is used to facilitate the process of coming to an agreement on a software design and to document it for current and future implementers, maintainers and other stakeholders of the software.
